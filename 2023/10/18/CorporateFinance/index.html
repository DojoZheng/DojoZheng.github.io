<p>A. The cash flows for Project B are an annuity, but those of Project A are not.<br>B. Both sets of cash flows have equal present values as of time zero given the same positive discount rate.<br>C. The present value of Project A cannot be computed because the second cash flow is equal to zero.<br><u><strong>D. As long as the discount rate is positive, Project B will always be worth less today than will Project A.</strong></u></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explanation</p>
<ul>
<li>Option A: Both Project A and B cash flows are not annuity as the cash flow each period in A is not of same amount, and the cash flow each period in B is also not of same amount. </li>
<li>Option B, C, D: You can change the RATE to any positive interest rate (assume that the rate &#x3D; 5% ) to prove the options make sense or not. Project A should worth more than Project B given the same positive interest rate because a higher proportion of A’s total cash flows occurs earlier than B’s. Even project A and B have the same amount of cash flows totally ($11,000), the distribution of the cash flows in each year is not the same. Given the same interest rate, they will not have the same present value. If the cash flow is zero, then the PV must be always zero.<br><strong>Excel formula: PV(rate, nper, pmt, fv)</strong><table>

<p>Explanation:<br>Option 1 is a $200,000 lump sum payment received today while option 2 is a annuity with monthly payments last for 20 years. We need to compare the PVs of the two options to see which one is more valuable today.<br>$$ APV &#x3D; \$1400 \times \frac{1-(1+\frac{0.06}{12})^{20 \times 12}}{\frac{0.06}{12}} &#x3D; \$195,413 $$</p>
<p>Excel:<br>$$PV(rate, nper, pmt, fv) &#x3D; PV(0.06 &#x2F; 12, 20*12, -1400, 0)&#x3D;195,413.08$$<br>Since PMT is a monthly payment, NPER has to be in months and RATE has to be monthly rate.</p>
