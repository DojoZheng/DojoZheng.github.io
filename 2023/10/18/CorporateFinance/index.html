Soo’s money is worth more than Louis’ money given the 7 percent discount rate.</p>
<pre><code class="Explanation">Although both Louis and Soo are going to receive the same amount $20,000, 
but they are not comparable as they are not received at the same point of time. 
$1 today worths more than $1 tomorrow (general rule). 
$20,000 received six years from today should be also worth more than $20,000 received nine years from now.

<p>A. The cash flows for Project B are an annuity, but those of Project A are not.<br>B. Both sets of cash flows have equal present values as of time zero given the same positive discount rate.<br>C. The present value of Project A cannot be computed because the second cash flow is equal to zero.<br><u><strong>D. As long as the discount rate is positive, Project B will always be worth less today than will Project A.</strong></u></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explanation</p>
<ul>
<li>Option A: Both Project A and B cash flows are not annuity as the cash flow each period in A is not of same amount, and the cash flow each period in B is also not of same amount. </li>
<li>Option B, C, D: You can change the RATE to any positive interest rate (assume that the rate &#x3D; 5% ) to prove the options make sense or not. Project A should worth more than Project B given the same positive interest rate because a higher proportion of A’s total cash flows occurs earlier than B’s. Even project A and B have the same amount of cash flows totally ($11,000), the distribution of the cash flows in each year is not the same. Given the same interest rate, they will not have the same present value. If the cash flow is zero, then the PV must be always zero.<br><strong>Excel formula: PV(rate, nper, pmt, fv)</strong><table>

<h2 id="Exercise-7"><a href="#Exercise-7" class="headerlink" title="Exercise 7"></a>Exercise 7</h2><blockquote>
<p>You are the beneficiary of a life insurance policy.<br>The insurance company informs you that you have two options for receiving the insurance proceeds.<br>You can receive a lump sum of $200,000 today,<br>or receive payments of $1,400 a month for 20 years.<br>You can earn 6% on your money.<br>Which option should you take and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A. You should accept the payments because they are worth $209,414 to you today.<br>B. You should accept the payments because they are worth $247,800 to you today.<br>C. You should accept the payments because they are worth $336,000 to you today.<br>D. You should accept the 200,000USD because the payments are only worth 189,311USD to you today.<br><strong><u>E. You should accept the 200,000USD because the payments are only worth 195,413USD to you today.</u></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explanation:<br>Option 1 is a $200,000 lump sum payment received today while option 2 is a annuity with monthly payments last for 20 years. We need to compare the PVs of the two options to see which one is more valuable today.<br>$$ APV &#x3D; \$1400 \times \frac{1-(1+\frac{0.06}{12})^{20 \times 12}}{\frac{0.06}{12}} &#x3D; \$195,413 $$</p>
